Fpath â€” File system paths for OCaml
===================================

Fpath is an OCaml module for handling file system paths with POSIX or
Windows conventions. Fpath processes paths without accessing the file
system and is independent from any system library.

Fpath depends on [Astring] and is distributed under the ISC license.

## Installation

Fpath can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install fpath

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation can be consulted [online] or via `odig doc fpath`.

Questions are welcome but better asked on the [OCaml forum] than on
the issue tracker.
